## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Yesenia, I'm a Graphic designer, also I'm currently studying computer systems, which I'll finish this summer. I love Asian food, especially ramen, and I enjoy video games and watching movies, TV shows, and romance novels.
I'm interested in augmented reality and curious about how far we can go with it. I also really like 3D models and everything related to it.
